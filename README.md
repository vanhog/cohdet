Disclaimer: This piece of software was written to be used with ESA's scihub data service. By end of October 2023, ESA dropped its scihub-service in favour of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem [CDSE](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/). This code is maintained for historical reason until a version compatible with CDSE is available. 

The software consists of a set of functions, used to stepwise process Sentinel-1 radar images from raw acquisitions to differential coherence maps.
